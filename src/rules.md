  # Below are the Rules for the Scavenger Hunt. 

  1. You may NOT under any circumstances use AI (ex. ChatGPT) or Google (*unless otherwise stated!*) to figure out the riddles. You may use parents as help. **Google Map (or alternative)is always permitted!** 
  2. Do NOT disclose any of the clues to other teams. Keep that information within your team only. 
  3. Do NOT tamper with any of the clues once you find them. 
  4. **DO NOT sabotage other teams!**
  5. Keep Moscow clean! Pick up after yourselves!
  6. Be respectful of all those around you, making sure to respect all city property and rules. 
  7. If you have a complaint or issue, talk to your team captain and they will speak with a Game Masters. 
  8. Be kind to your neighbor.
  9. Don’t cheat—even creatively! It is up to the Game Masters to decide if it is cheating. 
  10. Books are not cheating! In fact they are encouraged. 
  11. Difficulty will not be changed after registration, we encourage all teams with mostly older students, parents, or teachers to pick classical mode (hard).
  12. Clues will **NEVER** require entering dangerous or restricted areas.
  13. Include all team members when ever possible. Even the young ones!
  14. Remember to always be a good sport!
  15. Switching teams is not permitted unless given permission from a Game Master (as they have to edit the system). 
  16. And most importantly, have fun!
