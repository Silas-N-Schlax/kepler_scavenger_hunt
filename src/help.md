  # Below are Q&A, and ways to contact the Game Masters.
  
  ## How to play
    
  ### Login in to team profiles
  - To gain access to your team's profile you must scan your teams custom QR code either from the table at registration or from another team members phone!
  - Once you scan this QR code you can use the link, unless you switch to a new device, a new browser, or clear your browser data!

  ### Accessing clues
  - On your teams home page you will see a list of the clues with either a (✅) or a (🔐), if it is a (✅) then you can click it and see either a input field to answer the riddle or the riddle of the next clue if your team has already answered it!
  - Unlike accessing team pages, only one person from each team has to scan the QR code to unlock it for their team (everyone else just has to reload the page!). So if your team member happens across a QR code (with The Kepler logo on them! **DO NOT SCAN** random QR codes!), you can have it ready whenever you need it. Official Clue QR Codes will have the Kepler Logo in the center, anything else that is not a team QR CODE is **not official, and should be scanned at your own risk!!**
  
  ### How do clues and riddles work? 
  - There are four different parts for each clue.
  1. The Location, this will tell you either directly or indirectly the location of next clue (QR code).
  2. The riddle, this will be the riddle that you need to answer, you will put its answer in the next answer field (on the next clue!).
  3. The answer, this will be the answer for the riddle you currently are seeing once you complete it! (i.e. once you answer the riddle on clue 1, in the field on clue 2, the answer will appear on the clue 1 page).
  4. The answer field, before your team can access the next location and riddle, you must correctly answer, before you can gain access.

  ## Q&A
  
  1. Q. What is the number of players per team? A. There will be a minimum of 5 per team, and a maximum of 7 members per team. 
  2. Q. How do riddle answers work? A. The answers will be **one or two** words (never three or more), case insensitive, will contain no special characters, and no numbers. Good examples: BOB, bOb, BoB, boB, Bob. Wrong examples: B@b, B!23, B1@#.
  3. Q> How do I answer a riddle with a 2 word answer? A. Just put a space between the words, caps does not matter 
  4. Q. What if we cannot find the correct answer? A. If your team cannot figure out the answer, have your team captain contact a game master with at least 7 guesses for either a hint, or correction if necessary.
