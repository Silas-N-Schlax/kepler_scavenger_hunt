### These may or may not happen ;)

- Add the ability to edit admin tokens from admin portal.

- Have all users login using a 5 digit code (numbers only) every time, store in local storage and if it still exists auto login, otherwise prompt them to do it again, this also prevents cross-teaming, and no longer requires specific QR-codes for verification (although this can be an extra bit to lock up teams ;)

- Add session timeouts like every 48 hours or something for non restricted pages (i.e. Game Master, Admin, etc.) these will remain login every time

- Implement IP ban after 25 failed passwords attempts
